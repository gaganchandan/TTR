genCTC ---> we call isAbstract and accordingly execute --> now we have some input stmts if we move forward 
---> then we cal see.execute and execute till we run into a statement that isnt Ready


Note- isReady checks if the stmt has been evaluated and stored in valueEnvironment 
now isReady function will return false when 
its function call stmt, as output args wouldnt be 
there in the valueEnvironment (if they are not concrete values), and here we need to concretely call the Function and we 
get the function from the FunctionFactory class  

All inputs are parameters to the function 

x=input() <-- x= x1
f(x) --> r <-- isReady 


y : int := 0
// F1
y1 : int := y
x1 : int := input <int >()
assume (x1 < 10)
r1 : int := f(x1)<-- concretely 
assert (r1 = true )
assert (y2 = y1 + x1)


Actual Function Calls to 


 Statement 0: set_y(0)
  Statement 1: y1 := get_y()
  Statement 2: x1 := input()
  Statement 3: assume(Lt(x1, 10))
  Statement 4: r1 := f1(x1, 0)
  Statement 5: y2 := get_y()
  Statement 6: x2 := input()
  Statement 7: assume(Lt(x2, 10))
  Statement 8: r2 := f1(x2, 0)
