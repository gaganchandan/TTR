1. Wherever you are using global variables replace them with getters and setters treat 
them as part of the functionfactory and write logic in apps1 to get/set the variables (according to me done)

2. push the code to your github and share with sir 
3. share genATC code with documentation to navigate the code 
4. Compilation and Linking rules should be different even for the raw testcases in test folder. 




24/11/25
1. Change Makefile dependencies rule to depend on .hh files instead of .o (acc to me done)
2. (done) Write seperate testcases, for the rewrite atc. (acc to me done)
3. (done) Implement Interrupt Logic in genCTC to do that implement isReady() , implement the testcase given to you by sir.
4. (done) Calling the apis should be in symbolic execution. 
5. (done) Implement the logic to call the apis, (use app1 in apps)




22/11/25
1. (done) Use ComputePathConstraint instead of conjoin in see (acc to me done)
2. (done) get rid of clone, use a visitor implementation instead (acc to me done)
3. (done) Write testcases for tester

19/11/25
1. (done) Remove the relative paths in #include statements (everywhere)
2. (done) GenCTC fill in code (in tester) refer slides sir gave. 
3. (done) RewriteATC part of tester.( will be useful when we are interuptting the symex)



17/11/25
1. (done) Implement A Visitor class properly following the sample code that would be shared to me.
2. exprToString function to be also Implemented as a Visitor instead of a monolith



12/11/25
1. Make the commands to be in a DAG form rather than in Makefile than flatenning out 
2. (done) Change it from a monolith function to multiple visitors for different classes(what was done before).
3. (done)context of the z3 solver to not be passed around but should be a variable of inputmaker.
4. (done)  test_z3solver to only test z3 solver and not have dependencies on see (remove see from in these testcases && shift them to test_see) (done)
5. (done) Reduce Duplication of code in testcases file by using classes. 


10/11/25
1. Move semantics research + ppt
2. Change the sigma from map<string,Expr*> to the env type (done)
3. Implement z3 solver that takes in the path constraints and gives us the final output 
3.1 Compute path constraints would also (in see.cc) be need to Implemented
3.2 Visitor for z3 solver  
3.3 Translate the z3 model into result datastructure
3.4 Tests to run this.
